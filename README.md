# SSH-login-using-brute-force

SSH brute force tools are used to attempt to gain unauthorized access to an SSH server by
repeatedly trying different username and password combinations. These tools can be used
to attack both weak and strong passwords, but they are most effective against weak
passwords. Brute force tools are often used by attackers to gain access to servers and
other devices to steal data, install malware, or launch other attacks. However, SSH brute
force tools can also be used by security professionals to test the security of their own
systems and to identify potential vulnerabilities. This SSH brute force tool designed by us
will work by trying different username and password combinations by using the wordlist.
The wordlist is a text file which contains names or string characters which are used as
usernames and passwords. If the username and password are matched then, we can login
to the system or server using those credentials. The tool was designed by us using python
programming language. The tool requires username wordlist and password wordlist, port,
and host IP address
